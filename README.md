# Molecular dynamics simulations of ballistic impact tests

The molecular dynamics (MD) model used in our recent paper, published in [Computational Materials Science](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927025621002299), is shown below. This repository contains the LAMMPS files required to run MD simulations of impact tests of the aluminum/polyurea structure. The LAMMPS data file (240 MB) can be downloaded from here. The input and parameters files are available above (“spall_in.in” and “polyurethana_60nm.params”)



The provided MATLAB code, projectile_z_v.m, can be used to track the position and velocity of the projectile; a plot when the impact velocity is xxx km/s is shown below.



Good luck with your MD simulations.
